# Log Explorer TUI

**Log Explorer** is a terminal-based log analysis tool designed for clarity, flexibility, and modular extensibility.  
It supports a variety of log formats (structured and unstructured), search functionality, statistics, and visualizations ‚Äî all through a powerful TUI (Text User Interface). It also handles .gz, .bz2, .xz, and .lzma files automatically ‚Äî no manual decompression needed.

## üìñ Background

This project was created for the Boot.dev Hackathon.
Originally, the idea was to rewrite my first project, [py-json-analyzer](https://github.com/MS-32154/py-json-analyzer), in Go ‚Äî but ultimately decided to stick with Python because I'm still gaining flexibility with Go and was short on time.

So I built this tool in Python instead, focusing on log files rather than just JSON. I wrote the core engines myself, but AI helped significantly with regex pattern generation, debugging, and improving the code ‚Äî especially for the TUI, which was largely AI-generated.

While regex isn't the best tool for everything, this project aims for modularity and extensibility ‚Äî with plans for smarter parsing in the future.
